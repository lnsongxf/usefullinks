# Useful Links

These are some useful links that I have found while surfing the web. Please feel free to use them!

## Fortran

Hans Fehr and Fabian Kindermann are publishing a [new textbook](https://www.ce-fortran.com/) on Fortran for computational economics. Their website contains toolboxes useful, particularly for solving macro models.

## MATLAB

I often use MATLAB for simple dynamic programming, and for empirical asset pricing analyses. I share some programs that I have found useful at the [MATLAB Central File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/) here.

### Matlab2tikz

[This program](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22022-matlab2tikz-matlab2tikz) converts MATLABÂ®/Octave figures to TikZ/pgfplots figures for smooth integration into LaTeX.

### RGB

The colour coding feature [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46872-intuitive-rgb-color-values-from-xkcd) allows one to tailor plots and figures as needed.

### Progressbar

This [Progress bar](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6922-progressbar) is particularly useful when running long loops, particularly when one wants to enjoy a cup of tea.

## Dynare

I sometimes use [Dynare](http://www.dynare.org/) to solve macroeconomic models. One can find example files [here](http://www.dynare.org/documentation-and-support/examples).

# General Economics and Finance

## Macroeconomics

Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde's [website](http://economics.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/teaching.html) contains good series of lecture notes.

## Finance

### Corporate Finance

Todd Gormley has great PhD-level empirical corporate finance notes on his [website](http://www.gormley.info/phd-notes.html). Also check Roberts and Whited's handbook notes, published on SSRN [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1748604)

### Asset Pricing

John Cochrane's PhD-level [empirical asset pricing lecture notes](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.cochrane/teaching/Empirical_Asset_Pricing/#Documents).
