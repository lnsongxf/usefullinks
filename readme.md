These are some useful links that I have found while surfing the web. Please feel free to use them!

## MATLAB

I often use MATLAB for simple dynamic programming, and for empirical asset pricing analyses. I share some programs that I have found useful at the [MATLAB Central File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/) here.

### RGB

The colour coding feature [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46872-intuitive-rgb-color-values-from-xkcd) allows one to tailor plots and figures as needed.

### Progressbar

This [Progress bar](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6922-progressbar) is particularly useful when running long loops, particularly when one wants to enjoy a cup of tea.

## Dynare

I sometimes use [Dynare](http://www.dynare.org/) to solve macroeconomic models. One can find example files [here](http://www.dynare.org/documentation-and-support/examples).
